# Scenario: Form Submission Issues

## Background
You are a Product Owner for Acme Corporation. The development team recently deployed a new contact form to the staging environment.

## Stakeholder Report
A stakeholder has reported the following:

> "I tried to submit the contact form multiple times, but nothing happens when I click the Submit button. I filled in all my information, clicked Submit, and just... nothing. Is the form broken?"

## Your Task
As the Product Owner, you need to:

1. Investigate the issue
2. Reproduce the problem
3. Determine what's causing it
4. Prepare clear information for the development team

## Test Environment
The application is running at: http://localhost:5173

There are two test forms available:
- **Form A** - First implementation
- **Form B** - Alternative implementation

Both forms have been reported as having issues.

## What You Need to Do
- Try to use both forms as a normal user would
- Document what happens (or doesn't happen)
- Use any tools at your disposal to investigate
- Prepare a report with clear reproduction steps and findings

## Deliverables
Prepare a brief report covering:
1. What did you observe?
2. What steps did you take to investigate?
3. What did you discover?
4. What specific questions would you ask the development team?
5. What information would help them debug the issue?
